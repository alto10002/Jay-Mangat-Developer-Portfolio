# Description

I've put my various projects in this repo an as up-to-date example of what I'm working on. It began with a simple hardcoded dashboard I created during my Masters' program and has since evolved into a space where I try and bring my ideas to life. 

There's no real theme, just stuff I thought would be cool to show off or fun to learn about in my free time. Here's my [profile](www.linkedin.com/in/jay-mangat) if you'd like to reach out about anything.

If (for whatever reason) you want to run the site yourself, you can run `npm run dev` in the terminal from within the frontend folder. Just make sure you've installed the environment too.
